v 0.1

I create the project in one person. It is my first project which i hope will be finish.

I have to use the basic HTML and CSS without preprocessor or something like that.

I tried to solve the tasks with Vanilla JS. But the tasks force me to use some libraries and frameworks.

I use AngularJS since start.
